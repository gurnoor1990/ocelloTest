This code does hierarichical classificattion of parent-children objects.Parent-object is the main container object where as child-object is the located inside a parent object. The main underlining program in the ImageJ with the class library java.lang.object.ij.IJ. Some ImageJ plugins used in the code are Binarymasking,  black background and UseInversrLute(I did get the purpose of this but the boolean here was false). ObjectMapping.getMapping function you use 2 objects workers (public class InternalWorkers) and children to mark the co-ordinated of children and parents (parent indexes and child indexes).

Some undefined functions does not allow to run and test this class. These are:

LabeledObjectFactory.toMap()
LabeledObject.getMCPoint()
