This code does hierarichical classificattion of parent-children objects using two binary masks. Parent-object is the main container object where as child-object is the located inside a parent object. The intial properties of the image include black background and  UseInversrLute( I did not understand this?). Further, in the get mapping function you 2 list (workers(public class InternalWorkers) and children) are used to get co-ordinated of children (parent indexes and child indexes).

Presently, there are some undefined functions that does not allow to run and test this class. These are:
1. LabeledObjectFactory.toMap()
2. LabeledObject.getMCPoint()
